# Mia's Assignment B1

Welcome to my repository for Assignment B1. This README will serve as a brief introduction.

## Contents

This repository contains an .Rmd file and its knitted .md file. The code contained within creates a function called *total_summary*, which creates a table containing the mean, range, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of an inputted variable. Optionally, the data can be grouped by a grouping variable.

## How to use

To use this code, first fork the repository. Then, you can clone the repo onto your local computer. I suggest using RStudio to work with this code, as one of the files is an R Markdown. The packages you will need to install/load or noted within the files.
